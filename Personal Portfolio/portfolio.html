        Exploring CS Class
      </h2>
        <p>
        In my CS class during my sophomore year of high school, I learned a lot about computer           science and created a 
        <a href="https://portfoliocheck1-user6612741.ecshtml.repl.co/index.html">web portfolio</a> 
      which showcases the most interesting skills I learned in the class.

      <h2 class="projects">Personality Quiz</h2>
        <p>
          I created a personality quiz using HTML, CSS, and Javascript which determines whether the quiz taker is a morning person or a night owl. Click on the image below to take my quiz!

        Coding Languages
      </h2>
        <p>
        I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I am also planning to learn Python this summer and Java next year in my AP CS Class. I learned HTML and CSS from my CS class, and used Codecademy to brush up on my skills.
